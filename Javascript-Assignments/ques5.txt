Q5. Difference between '==' and '===' operators:
Ans:

'==' operators just checks the values of two operands not their datatypes.So,if the values are equal even though the datatypes don't match It will return as true .
eg:
var a=5;
var b='5';
var c=5;
a==b;
true
a==c
true


'===' operators not only checks the values of two operands but also their datatypes.So,if the values and the datatypes matches It will return as true else false .
eg:

a===b
false
a===c
true
